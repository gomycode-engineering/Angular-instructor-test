# Angular Technical Test

We've designed a small remote technical test, that is open ended. You should be able to make choices and assumptions without guidance. We're interested in seeing how you think and architect out the code. You should not spend more than 24 hours on this so think strategically about what you want to show.

Clone this repo and send us a link to your work.

### Spec:

We want to test your ability to write clean modular angular code that talks to a RESTful API endpoints.

- Build a Movie app single page application.
- Add/Delete todo items
- Ability to filter movies in the movie list using the title

We have set up for you a project and a mock local server.

- GET from http://localhost:3000/movies ← list all movies items
- GET from http://localhost:3000/movies/<movie-id> ← list details about a movie
- POST from http://localhost:3000/movies ← add new movie to the list

###  We would like to see the following:

- Styled components
- Modular Angular code
